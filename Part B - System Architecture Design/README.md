# Scalable E-commerce Cloud Architecture

## System Flow

### 1. DNS Resolution
Users access the application through domain names (e.g., `api.ecommerce.com`). The Domain Name System (DNS) returns the IP address of our Azure Application Gateway to the browser or mobile app.

### 2. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Azure CDN is positioned as the first layer to serve static content:

Caches static assets like images, CSS, JavaScript files, and product images
Serves content from edge locations closest to the user
Reduces load on origin servers and improves page load times globally
Handles cache expiry and invalidation for updated content

### 3. Application Gateway & Load Balancing
Once the IP address is obtained, HTTP requests are sent to the Azure Application Gateway. It acts as a **Load Balancer.** A load balancer evenly distributes incoming traffic among web servers that are defined in a
load-balanced set. The Application Gateway evenly distributes incoming traffic among AKS nodes using private IPs for secure communication between services. 

### 4. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) hosts all the backend logic of the application using containerized microservices. Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain—such as authentication, catalog, cart, or order processing.

These services are:

- Deployed as pods inside the AKS cluster
- Exposed through internal service endpoints and accessible via an ingress controller
- Horizontally scalable, meaning AKS can increase or decrease the number of pods based on traffic and load
- Isolated, so that heavy processing in one service does not impact the performance of others

With AKS, the backend benefits from:
- Automated service discovery
- Resilient deployments with health checks and restarts
- Load balancing across service instances
- Seamless updates with zero downtime using rolling deployments
- Each service can be scaled independently based on traffic demands.

### 5. Database Layer - Master-Slave Configuration
The backend handles different types of read and write APIs through a master-slave database setup:
- **Master Database**: Handles all write operations (insert, delete, update)
- **Slave Databases**: Handle read operations with data copied from master
- **Zone-Redundant Storage**: Data replication across Zone 1 and Zone 2 for high availability

### 6. Background Processing
For handling large amounts of data:
- **Azure Service Bus**: Message queue system for asynchronous communication
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless background workers that process queued messages
- **Batch Jobs**: Handle bulk data imports, analytics, and reporting tasks

### 7. Caching Layer
**Redis Cache** serves as a temporary data store layer, much faster than the database:
- Caches frequently accessed product data
- Stores user session information
- Reduces database workload significantly

### 8. External System Integration
The application relies on external systems for fetching product lists:
- **Dedicated Catalog Service**: A dedicated backend microservice within the AKS cluster is responsible for communicating with external product APIs. This ensures that integration logic is isolated from other critical workflows.
- **Asynchronous Fetching with Background Workers**: To avoid delays in user-facing APIs, product data is often fetched asynchronously using Azure Service Bus and Azure Functions. This offloads the work to background jobs, allowing for scheduled or triggered syncs.
- **Caching Layer with Redis**: Fetched product data is cached in Redis to ensure fast responses for high-frequency queries like product browsing or search. Redis reduces repeated external API calls, improves latency, and ensures the app stays responsive even if the external system is slow or temporarily down.


### 9. Scalability of the System
This architecture is designed with horizontal scalability, decoupled components, and auto-scaling mechanisms to efficiently handle high traffic and variable loads across the globe.
- **Microservices on Kubernetes (AKS)**: Each service (e.g., authentication, catalog, order) runs independently in containers and can be scaled out horizontally based on demand. This ensures that increasing load on one part of the system doesn’t degrade others.
- **Auto-Scaling**: The system supports horizontal pod autoscaling and cluster autoscaling, allowing infrastructure to expand and contract based on CPU/memory usage or custom traffic metrics—resulting in optimized cost and performance.
- **Load Balancing at Multiple Layers**: Global requests are routed through Azure Application Gateway or Front Door, distributing traffic intelligently across zones and regions. Internal services are balanced through Kubernetes services and ingress controllers.
- **Message Queue for Traffic Bursting**: High-volume background tasks are offloaded to Azure Service Bus Queues, decoupling real-time processing from asynchronous workloads. This prevents overload and enables background services to scale independently.
- **Read/Write Database Separation**: A PostgreSQL primary-replica setup supports write-heavy operations on the master and read-heavy queries on replicas—avoiding bottlenecks during peak shopping periods.
- **Redis Caching Tier**: Reduces load on databases and external APIs by serving frequently accessed data instantly. Redis scales horizontally to maintain low latency as demand increases.

### 10. Monitoring & Observability
**Prometheus & Grafana**: 
- Collect and visualize Kubernetes cluster metrics
- Monitor application performance and resource utilization
- Set up alerts for system health issues

**Azure Log Analytics**:
- Centralized logging for all Azure services
- Application logs and error tracking
- Security audit logs and compliance monitoring

## Global Traffic Handling

The architecture handles global traffic with variable peak hours through:
- **Multi-region deployment** across different Azure regions
- **Auto-scaling groups** that adjust based on traffic patterns
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** for static content delivery
- **Regional database replicas** for improved read performance

## Cost Optimization Features

- **Auto-scaling**: Scales resources up during peak hours, down during low traffic
- **Spot Instances**: Used for non-critical background processing tasks
- **Reserved Instances**: For baseline capacity requirements
- **Intelligent Storage Tiering**: Moves infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage tiers

This architecture ensures the e-commerce platform can scale from thousands to millions of concurrent users while maintaining high availability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.
